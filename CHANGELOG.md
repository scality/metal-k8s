  (PR [#2743](https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/pull/2743))

- Storage Operator no longer spams Salt API because of an infinite reconciliation loop
  (Commit [b0eca3d84](https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/commit/b0eca3d84e13c37235e0780cc84490cc7f6644e9), PR [#2651](https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/pull/2651))

## Release 2.5.1

### Breaking changes

- Solutions product information format has changed, there is a new
  `manifest.yaml` file to describe the whole Solution instead of the
  `product.txt` and `config.yaml`
  ([#2422](https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/issues/2422)).
  Solution archives working on previous versions of MetalK8s will no
  longer be compatible and will need to be regenerated.
  See [Solutions documentation](https://metal-k8s.readthedocs.io/en/development-2.5/developer/solutions/archive.html#product-information)
  for details about the new format.

## Release 2.5.0

### Breaking changes
- Basic authentication has been deprecated in favour of OpenID Connect (OIDC)
  with Dex being deployed as a local Identity Provider, used by Kubernetes
  API and Grafana.

  This implies:
    - The existing users defined for Kubernetes API Basic Auth in
      (`/etc/kubernetes/htpasswd`) and for the Grafana admin will become
      unusable
    - A default admin user will be created in Dex, with the new
      credentials `admin@metalk8s.invalid`:`password` which can be used to
      access the MetalK8s UI and Grafana
    - Procedures to edit and add new users can now be found
      [here](https://metal-k8s.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.0/operation/account_administration.html)

- A new framework for persisting Cluster and Services Configurations (CSC) has
  been added to ensure configurations set by administrators are not lost during
  upgrade or downgrade and can be found [here](https://metal-k8s.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.0/developer/architecture/configurations.html).

  - User-provided configuration is now stored in ConfigMaps, and MetalK8s
    tooling will honor the values provided when deploying its services:
      - Dex uses `metalk8s-auth/metalk8s-dex-config`
      - Grafana uses `metalk8s-monitoring/metalk8s-grafana-config`
      - Prometheus uses `metalk8s-monitoring/metalk8s-prometheus-config`
      - Alertmanager uses `metalk8s-monitoring/metalk8s-alertmanager-config`

  - Documentation for changing and applying configuration values is
    found [here](https://metal-k8s.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.0/operation/cluster_and_service_configuration.html).

    Note that any configuration applied on other Kubernetes objects
    (e.g. a configuration Secret that Alertmanager uses, or the
    Deployment of Grafana) will be lost upon upgrade, and admins
    should make sure to prepare the relevant ConfigMaps from their
    existing configuration before upgrading to this version.

- The MetalK8s [UI](https://metal-k8s.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.0/installation/services.html#metalk8s-gui)
  has been re-branded with lots of changes to the Login screens and Navbar to
  offer a smoother experience.

### Security fixes
- Due to critical vulnerabilities (
[CVE-2020-11652](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11652)
and
[CVE-2020-11651](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11651))
with CVSS score of 10.0 affecting all Salt master versions inferior to
`3000.2`, this release ships with all Saltstack updated to `3000.3`.
Users, especially those who expose the Salt master to the Internet must
therefore upgrade immediately.

    to version `3000.3`

[CVE-2020-13379](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13379)
with CVSS score of 5.3 that was discovered affecting Grafana versions from
`3.0.1` through `7.0.1`, this release ships with a Grafana version updated to
`6.7.4`. For more, see [here](https://grafana.com/blog/2020/06/03/grafana-6.7.4-and-7.0.2-released-with-important-security-fix/)

### Breaking changes
- If `apiServer.host` is configured in `BootstrapConfiguration`, this is no
longer used (and must no longer be defined).
- If `apiServer.keepalived` is configured in `BootstrapConfiguration`, this is
no longer used, and Keepalived is no longer deployed at all.

host on which they are generated. You can override this when using them using
